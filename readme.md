# Simple Image Slider

- Nice Image Slider .
- Beautiful Text Animation .

## Description

- The whole project is written in vanilla JavaScript, which is extremely impractical, but I wanted to practice and maybe also show you that I know vanilla JS and that it excites me tremendously. Of course, the code is not fully refactored, but I'm satisfied with how it is. I believe it's good practice to occasionally write a project in vanilla JS for anyone who wants to improve their skills in this language. That's why I decided to write it this way. I would also like to point out that I found some creative solutions regarding the project, which ultimately shows my style, just like the way I wrote the HTML for the h1.
